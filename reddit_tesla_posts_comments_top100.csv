Looks like he  is setting up the framework to explain why he is going to default on his $13B loan. The house of cards is crashing down.,16apwc3,"Elon Musk blames the ADL for 60% ad sales decline at X, threatens to sue"
"I've always heard that he was like Donald Trump, and there are similarities, way more differences than similarities, but suing a non-profit focused on anti-defamation for wrecking his profits is arguably the most Trumpian shit he's done. This is embarrassing. At this point he should just consider dumping it off to someone else for a quarter of the price. The longer he waits, the better the competition down the line will be, when someone inevitably makes a better and more profitable app. Turning Twitter into 4Chan is a stupid fucking idea. Its like turning CNN into an independent YouTube channel, that's not the audience, the people who use mainstream apps like this, don't use 4Chan. Twitter is the deepest they'll go down online forums, that's why they're on Twitter and not 4Chan. Simultaneously the app has value, it can win you fucking elections and bring in profits for companies, en masse. I don't get why he didn't just hire a team of engineers and build a competitor on his own. Dude bought a broken down Ferrari to break it even more instead of just buying a new Ferrari at a 1/100000th of a percentage of the cost.",16apwc3,"Elon Musk blames the ADL for 60% ad sales decline at X, threatens to sue"

The ADL often conflates disliking a country for hate speech.

"**From The Telegraph's Matthew Field:**

Amazon has been accused of ignoring a ‚Äúglaring conflict of interest‚Äù when awarding hundreds of millions of dollars in rocket contracts to a company owned by Jeff Bezos.

A lawsuit filed by an Amazon shareholder accuses the e-commerce giant‚Äôs board of acting ‚Äúin bad faith‚Äù after handing a contract to Mr Bezos‚Äôs rocket company, Blue Origin, after less than 40 minutes of discussion.

Amazon is planning to launch a vast network of more than 3,000 satellites that will provide internet access around the world.

As part of the plan, it must contract rocket companies to fire its satellites into space.

Amazon has already paid about $1.7bn to three companies, including $585m to Mr Bezos‚Äôs Blue Origin. Its other contracts are with France‚Äôs Arianespace and United Launch Alliance.

The Cleveland Bakers and Teamsters Pension Fund, which is bringing the lawsuit, said the rocket launch contract was the ‚Äúsecond largest‚Äù in Amazon‚Äôs history, after its $13.7bn takeover of Whole Foods.

The legal claim alleges the company‚Äôs audit committee ‚Äúinexplicably‚Äù did not consider awarding the contract to rival billionaire Elon Musk‚Äôs SpaceX, despite the rival company‚Äôs track record for successful rocket launches.

SpaceX was not among the options presented to board members, the lawsuit claims.

The lawsuit argues the board had little role in negotiations. Instead, Mr Bezos and his team led the negotiations with a company he also owned, it is claimed.

"\> ""I would just move my desk around the factory to wherever the biggest problem was.""

well yeah wherever his desk was would be where the biggest problem is

eta: Also, micromanagement (which seems to be Elon's preferred style of running things since the zip2/paypal days) has been studied extensively since it became a popular way to do things in the 90s and it has been roundly proven to be an absolutely terrible way of running your business, is completely ruinous on the mental health of your employees and does nothing to increase productivity. It does the opposite in fact. When your workers are all totally miserable to be there and living in fear of you suddenly breathing down their neck demanding to see your work and yelling at you for not reading their minds about the way they wanted something done, it does nothing to make them happier employees giving you better outcomes. 

Story time: Way back before text to speech software was a thing, I used to be a medical transcriptionist for a boss who, among other things, made us sign a book every time we went to the bathroom, would time us every trip and if she thought we were 'taking too long', would *go into the bathroom to check up on you.* She had a screaming meltdown at us one day because we dared to shut out computers down at 5.58pm (and we did 10 hour days there), ranting about how we were being paid to work until 6 so we damn well would sit there until 6 because she didn't employ thieves. That's right she considered us to be stealing from the company if we left even one second earlier than *her* watch saying 6pm. Needless to say I didn't last long there and in fact had a nervous breakdown from being 'managed' like that. I've read many an anecdote of Elon being exactly this kind of manager.

The much-hyped cage fight between Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg, two giants of the tech world, appears to be on after the Italian government said it had agreed to host ‚Äúa big event‚Äù at an ancient Roman location.  
The Italian culture ministry said it was planning to hold a large event involving the rival billionaires in a historical setting.  
It would not be held in the Colosseum, as had been mooted previously, but in another location somewhere in Italy, a ministry spokesman told The Telegraph.

"Sensible [tweet](https://twitter.com/Teslaconomics/status/1688424641407381504) from @Teslaconomics:

> All bets for the fight w/ Zuck are off if Elon needs to have surgery in his neck and/or upper back. This is NOT be a good idea especially if Elon‚Äôs MRI outcome results in surgery. 

> First off, Elon‚Äôs health comes first, just like yours or mine would. The fact that he‚Äôs needing an MRI for his neck and upper back is a sign that there may be some health concerns that need to be addressed. If he‚Äôs looking at potential surgery, this isn‚Äôt something that should be ignored. Jumping into a physical showdown with these concerns on the table is very risky, not just for Elon‚Äôs health, but for the many who depend on him: employees, customers, investors, and the world‚Äôs future. 

> Second off, let‚Äôs not forget what this fight with Zuck is really about. It‚Äôs a clash of ideologies & visions for the future, not so much a test of who can throw the better punch. Elon‚Äôs strongest weapon isn‚Äôt his ‚ÄúWalrus‚Äù attack, it‚Äôs his vision, his heart for innovation, and his relentless drive to challenge the status quo in order to make the future better. 

> And thirdly, instead of throwing punches, Elon & Zuck could both be working together to create real change by addressing their disagreements in a constructive manner - for example, channeling their energies into a joint project, event, or dialogue with primary initiatives aiming to reconcile their differing perspectives.

> After all, this is where the real victory lies - in creating a better world for us all, not just winning a single fight that can have catastrophic outcomes. Please re-consider @elonmusk.",15kjs86,Zuckerberg ready for cage fight but Musk isn't committing
